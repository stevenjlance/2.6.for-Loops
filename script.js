// ======= TRAVERSING ARRAYS WITH FOR LOOPS ===========
const names = ["Yadira", "Kadiatou", "Isaiah", "Fancisco", "Darius"]
const nicknames = ["Deary", "Kadi-B", "Izzy", "Paco", "DRock"]
const ages = [22, 28, 27, 33, 29]
const favAnimals = ["Cat", "Ferret", "Dog", "Sloth", "Zebra"]
const birthLocations = ["Queens", "Bronx", "Manhattan", "Bronx", "Brooklyn"]

// 7. CODE-ALONG: Print our all of the names in the list



// 8. CODE-ALONG: Print out "________ was born in _________" for each individual




// 9. Print out "_________ goes by the name _______ and is ________ years old"



/* 10. Print out info for each person. For example, it may look like:
Name: Yadira
Nickname: "Deary"
Age: 22
Favorite Animal: Cat
Birth Location: Queens
*/ 



// =========== NESTED DATA & FOR LOOPS =============
// 11. The current data would make sense much more as an object rather than individual arrays. Use a for loop to update the people array with objects for each person.

const people = []



// 12. Using the new people array you created and a for loop, print out "_________'s nickname is _______" for each person.




// 13. Using the new people array you created and a for loop, print out "_________'s favorite animal is _______" for each person.



/*14. STRETCH: Can you make each object an HTML list? For example, one may look like:
<ul>
<li>Name: Yadira</li>
<li>Nickname: "Deary"</li>
<li>Age: 22</li>
<li>Favorite Animal: Cat</li>
<li>Birth Location: Queens</li>
</ul>
